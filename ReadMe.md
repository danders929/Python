Repository for small projects that I've used for learning Python.

**Age Calculator** - Calculates when a person will turn 100. Will repeat an X number of times depending on what the user's "Lucky Number" is. 
Displays fun messages depending on user's age.

**EvenOdd** - User enters 2 numbers and the program returns whether the first one is even or odd. Returns other results for fun like if the first number is divisible
by the second number, a multiple of four, or if the user is cheeky and enters 0 for either number.
